= Key Block Features =
* Intelligent Load – Kadence Blocks only loads CSS or Javascript when you need it and only for the blocks you are using on a specific page.
* Responsive Controls – Tweak your design for each screen size. Edit tablet and mobile settings while previewing in WordPress editor.
* Typography Controls – Choose from 900+ Google fonts and design your site with complete typography control.
* Color & Background Controls – Gradients, overlays, parallax backgrounds, borders, etc. You can control all the design settings!
* Configurable Defaults – Make development a breeze. Once the default settings are defined, every time you add a block those settings will automatically be applied.
